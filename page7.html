            <p>I am truly thankful to my family for pushing me this far to continue to belive in me and my academic progress. 
                I understand that in the past I have not been seen as much of an academic weapon but I do try my hardest each 
                and every day. My classes are a challange to me and studying and retaining the information is a little difficult 
                but I am doing my best for them and for myself. Stuff like this project I experiened a lot of trouble where I didnt 
                quite know what I was doing, and have some things to definetly work on.
            </p>
